# Report of Internship at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago

Yota Toyama (Student ID: 16423)


## Life

After I and Tsujimura got the O'Hare airport, we took a train and a bus to go
to our apartment in the southside of the downtown.
When getting off a bus, we were just standing to wait for its doors to be open.
But, they did not.
After a while, passengers behind us told that we should push the door.
We had never known such semi-automatic system.
People in Chicao were very kind and helpful.

There was a supermarket named Whole Foods near our apartment.
It was a little more expensive than other ones but sold healthy and organic
foods of good quality.
I thought that foods in the US are much chearper than in Japan.
However, that was not true at least in Chicago.
Some stuffs like meat seemed to be even more expensive than ones in Japan.
It can be because Chicago is a big city and they can be cheaper in rural areas,
I guess.

When I arrived there, I had hay fever which I never had in the same season
in Japan.
So, I needed to buy medicine againt it.
They were pretty expensive by 30 dollars per bottle.


## Study

### Class

I took a class of Machine Learning, titled Introduction to Statictical Machine
Learning.
At first, I was also taking a class of Mathematical Toolkit.
But, I found that it took too much time from me so that I cannot have time
to work on my research.
Therefore, I calceled it and focused on the ML class and my research task.

In the ML class, we studied about themes of wide range from basic ML
to its application and some state-of-the-art stuffs like Neural Network.
The models used in the class were supervised ones mostly.
In 3 to 4 of the firsts classes, we learned about base of ML of
probability, algebras, model complexity, overfitting, and bias and variance.

Its assignments were exciting.
As in Japan, we had some mathematical problems of symbolic calculation and
proofs.
In addition to them, we had competitions in our homework a few times.
To hold the competitions, the professor of the ML class used an online service
named Kaggle.
It is famous among ML and data science researchers and students and holds
some public competitions of ML and data analytics.
We had 4 competitions of multivariate logistic regression of MNIST hand-written
digit classifiaction, linear and non-linear SVM of sentiment analysis,
Gaussian mixture model, and Multi Layer Perceptron.


### Research

I had worked on research with my advisor, David McAllester at TTIC.
Since I had only 3 months, I could not achieve something new but learned a lot.
The research task was Question Answering where we need to
It has relation to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML).
While I am working on Sentiment Classifiaction at TTI in Japan,
I asked Mr. McAllester to give a different task to learn something which is
different from Sentiment Classifiaction and appropriate for me to learn
in TTIC.
I tried implementing a model proposed by Rudolf Kadlec et al.  so called
Attention Sum Reader.
The library I used is TensorFlow.
It is the neural network library I am the most familiar with and
has a distributed computing feature, and cloud and other commercial support
by Google.

TTIC has 2 clusters of Gauda and Slurm.
The former one is an older one and an adiministrator said its resources can be
merged into the Slurm cluster.
The latter one is a newer one.
It is equipped with a bunch of (around 20) computers with multiple CPUs and
GPUs.
It is a sophisticated environment for research.
Anybody in TTIC can use them if their permissions are granted.
There are many tools and libraries like OpenMP and Eigen to exploit multiple
CPUs in a box.
Moreover, some tools and libraries provides convevient ways to deploy programs
onto multiple devices and create a distributed system which consists of
multiple processes running on them.



## How to make use of the experience

Especially on research, I am pretty sure that I can apply knowledge I got
at TTIC to my research work.
The best knowledge I got there is one about distributed computing and
how to exploit multiple GPUs and CPUs over multiple devices in a network or
cluster.
Although my laboratory does not have any cluster like ones in TTIC,
the techniques and tools like can be applied.
