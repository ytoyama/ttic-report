# TTIC report

Yota Toyama (16423)


## Life

When I arrived there, I god hay fever which I never had in the same season
in Japan.

There was a supermarket named Whole Foods near our apartment.
It was a little more expensive than other ones but sold healthy and organic
foods of good quality.


## Study

### Class

I took a class of Machine Learning, titled Introduction to Statictical Machine
Learning.


### Research

I had worked on research with my advisor, David McAllester at TTIC.
Since I had only 3 months, I could not achieve something new but learned a lot.
The research task was Question Answering where we need to
It has relation to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML).
While I am working on Sentiment Classifiaction at TTI in Japan,
I asked Mr. McAllester to give a different task to learn something which is
different from Sentiment Classifiaction and appropriate for me to learn
in TTIC.
I tried implementing a model proposed by Rudolf Kadlec et al.  so called
Attention Sum Reader.
The library I used is TensorFlow.
It is the neural network library I am the most familiar with and
has a distributed computing feature and commercial support by Google.


## How to make use of the experience
